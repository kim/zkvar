# ZKVar

A little experiment to provide an interface similar to
[MVar](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html) around
[Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). Uses John Billings excellent, yet unreleased
[zookeeper](https://github.com/jnb/zookeeper) bindings.
